[parser.notes]

A collection of comments received from people I have given this parser to.
These changes have _NOT_  been made in the distribution as it now stands,
and are untested.  You may incorporate them into the code if you wish.

Subject: vl2mv

viraphol: Thanks for the pointers to the Verilog parser.  I have obtained it and
been working on bringing it up.

riepe: I received your version of vl2mv.  I have had some problems compiling it
on my Sparc2.  However, after some bug fixes described below, I have it parsing
and printing out the parse tree of a several page Verilog program.

stcheng: I wanted to let you know that I ftp'ed a copy of vl2mv.  In addition, I
received a second copy from riepe.  He had made his version compile and run for
him so I started working with his sources.  I instantly ran into several
problems which I will describe below.  If any of you have already debugged the
stuff I am finding, I would appreciate knowing.  I am mainly parsing behavioral
Verilog.  Has this parser been used for that yet?

My problems:

1) In verilog.l, the parsing of strings seems broken.  I made the following
change:

97c102
< <Snormal>\"[^"]*\"          { return YYSTRING; }             <-- new
---
> <Snormal>\"[^"]*            { return YYSTRING; }             <-- old

2) In verilog.l, form-feeds don't count as whitespace (section 2.2 of March 1991
Cadence Verilog manual).  I changed the following:

54c56
< Space       [\n\r\t\b\f ]					<-- new
---
> Space       [\n\r\t\b ]					<-- old
220c225
< <Snormal>\\[^\n\t\b\r\f ]*    { 				<-- new
---
> <Snormal>\\[^\n\t\b\r ]*      { 				<-- old

3) In verilog.y, vl_create_expr was called with the wrong number of
arguments in rule "function_call : identifier '(' expression_list ')'":

3011c3014
< 				  $1, $3, NIL(void));		<-- new
---
> 				  $1, $3);			<-- old

4) In verilog.y, syntax "port_list : port | port_list ',' port", handle was
declared and used incorrectly:

414c416
< 	      lsHandle handle;					<-- new
---
> 	      lsHandle *handle;					<-- old
417c419
< 	      lsNewEnd($1, (lsGeneric)$3, &handle);		<-- new
---
> 	      lsNewEnd($1, (lsGeneric)$3, handle);		<-- old

5) In verilog.y, syntax "function : YYFUNCTION range_or_type_opt YYID ';'
tf_declaration_eclr statement_opt YYENDFUNCTION", I had to write it as follows:

	      if ($2 == NIL(vl_range_or_type)) {
		  func_type = IntFuncDecl; /* default function type */
		  $$ = vl_create_function(func_type, NIL(vl_range), $<idrng>4, $6, $7);
	      } else {
		  switch ($2->type) {
		  case Range_Dcl: func_type = RangeFuncDecl; break;
		  case Integer_Dcl: func_type = IntFuncDecl; break;
		  case Real_Dcl: func_type = RealFuncDecl; break; 
		  default: internal_error("unknown function type");
		  }
		  $$ = vl_create_function(func_type, $2->range, $<idrng>4, $6, $7);
	      }

You had written it as

	      if ($2 == NIL(vl_range_or_type)) {
		  func_type = IntFuncDecl; /* default function type */
	      } else {
		  switch ($2->type) {
		  case Range_Dcl: func_type = RangeFuncDecl; break;
		  case Integer_Dcl: func_type = IntFuncDecl; break;
		  case Real_Dcl: func_type = RealFuncDecl; break; 
		  defualt: internal_error("unknown function type");
		  }
	      }
	      $$ = vl_create_function(func_type, $2->range, $<idrng>4, $6, $7);

This can cause "$2->range" to follow a null pointer.  Some computers allow this
but generally it is a bad idea.

	Thanks for posting this info. I made a minor change to
    vl2mv/include/util.h to get the parser to compile on HP-UX:
